;;; Commentary:

;; Migemo extension of `anything'. Use `anything-migemo' instead of
;; `anything'. If `anything-migemo' is invoked with prefix argument,
;; `anything' is migemo-ized. This means that pattern matching of
;; `anything' candidates is done by migemo-expanded `anything-pattern'.

;;; Setting:

;; (require 'anything-config)
;; (require 'anything-migemo)
;; (define-key global-map [(control ?:)] 'anything-migemo)
